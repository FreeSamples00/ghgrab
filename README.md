# ghgrab - grab anything you want

Ever found a single file or folder in a massive GitHub repo and wished you could just *grab it* without cloning the whole thing? That's exactly why **ghgrab** exists. 

It's a simple, pretty terminal tool that lets you pick what you need and download it instantly. No clutter, no `git clone` waiting times, just the stuff you want.
